Week 1

I didnt use AI much this week and when i did use it I closed the tab. I only used AI for two things. I used it to help set up github and two help to figure out soem different jobs that are available for 
When I get my INFO SCI degree. In my 314 class I needed to set up my get hub account and a lof of the instructions were confusing, they me to all these different websites and had me following
multiple sets of instructions. I was very lost so I uploaded the directions to Chatgpt to help guide me through it all. The other thing used AI for is to help answer questions about what
jobs are available with an info sci degree. I plan on being a pilot and need a degree. I chose Info Sci because it was a really fast growing degree and worked with a lot of relevent stuff to 
todays world. but it is a backup plan so ive been more focused on flight schools and what I hope to do rather than what i might need to do later down the line. That's what I used AI for this week.
