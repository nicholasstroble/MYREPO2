Week 1

I didnt use AI much this week and when i did use it I closed the tab. I only used AI for two things. I used it to help set up github and two help to figure out soem different jobs that are available for 
When I get my INFO SCI degree. In my 314 class I needed to set up my get hub account and a lof of the instructions were confusing, they me to all these different websites and had me following
multiple sets of instructions. I was very lost so I uploaded the directions to Chatgpt to help guide me through it all. The other thing used AI for is to help answer questions about what
jobs are available with an info sci degree. I plan on being a pilot and need a degree. I chose Info Sci because it was a really fast growing degree and worked with a lot of relevent stuff to 
todays world. but it is a backup plan so ive been more focused on flight schools and what I hope to do rather than what i might need to do later down the line. That's what I used AI for this week.

Week 2

This was another week where I didnt use AI too much but I think I wrote in the discussion how I was using it to help my study spanish.
My spanish is absolutely horrible but I am seeign progress. I am not banking on being fluent nest week or anything like that but I am hoping to make
consistent progress. I beleive AI can help me do that. I used AI to help me figure out some of the most commonly used words as well as some of the most
frequent mistakes new learners usually make. AI has been know to not be perfect especially when making traslationg between languages. Most of the 
time it is more useful to have interpretation rather than translations. But yes for know understanding my oen mistakes when forming scentences and 
adding to my vocanulary is all I am using AI for but in the future I do hope to expand on this and maybe even use it for active speaking and listening
practice.

Week 3
I have already uaed AI quite a bit this week. In the first week I needed to use AI to help me get git hub installed and how to connect it to Rstudio. I had also used it for SQL workbench. 
This week I needed to use it for SQL again becasue it just wasn't working. I was folllowing along with my instructors code and very quicly realized none of my code woud run. I double and triple
checked it to make sure everything is right but it just didt work. So I typles the intput and output into chatGPT and xplained the situation. This was antoher instance in my life where
chatGPT just wasn't fully there. After a bit of back and forth with it I was able to notice a trend in the code that was working and what wasn't. Yet it never recommended or pointed it out.
I would even tell it that because I am not using the "USE" function, it works. It would acknowledge my comment essentially say im smart but then wouldn't say why that would be that case then
tell me to do the trouble shooting code it had before. This was pointless because I already know the "solution" and it's not offering me anything of use. That was the big thing I used AI for this
week. Everything Ended up working and the trouble shooting with GPT did help but not in the way it was intended to.

Week 4
I finally started using AI for learning spanish. It is extremely helpful. I am able to practice reading and writing then get immediate feedback.
If there is a particular scentence I am struggling with I can type it in then have it go word by word and explain it to me. I definitely have to take
it with a grain of salt but I have a really good feeling with the continued use of it.

Week 5
I used AI this week to explain various topics from my different classes. I had a few issues with R Studio, again. I ran it through AI and I was able
to figure it out. I have a marathon coming up in a couple weeks and have been struggling for good sleep so I have been using it to help me find recources
for advice. Stretching is also something I need to get better at but AI is giving me some pointers on that becasue it saw that I was looking at sleep
and it was able to figure out that I might have needed help with stretching and other athlete self care items.
