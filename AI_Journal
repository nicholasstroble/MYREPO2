Week 1

I didnt use AI much this week and when i did use it I closed the tab. I only used AI for two things. I used it to help set up github and two help to figure out soem different jobs that are available for 
When I get my INFO SCI degree. In my 314 class I needed to set up my get hub account and a lof of the instructions were confusing, they me to all these different websites and had me following
multiple sets of instructions. I was very lost so I uploaded the directions to Chatgpt to help guide me through it all. The other thing used AI for is to help answer questions about what
jobs are available with an info sci degree. I plan on being a pilot and need a degree. I chose Info Sci because it was a really fast growing degree and worked with a lot of relevent stuff to 
todays world. but it is a backup plan so ive been more focused on flight schools and what I hope to do rather than what i might need to do later down the line. That's what I used AI for this week.

Week 2

This was another week where I didnt use AI too much but I think I wrote in the discussion how I was using it to help my study spanish.
My spanish is absolutely horrible but I am seeign progress. I am not banking on being fluent nest week or anything like that but I am hoping to make
consistent progress. I beleive AI can help me do that. I used AI to help me figure out some of the most commonly used words as well as some of the most
frequent mistakes new learners usually make. AI has been know to not be perfect especially when making traslationg between languages. Most of the 
time it is more useful to have interpretation rather than translations. But yes for know understanding my oen mistakes when forming scentences and 
adding to my vocanulary is all I am using AI for but in the future I do hope to expand on this and maybe even use it for active speaking and listening
practice.
